#summary How to install sSearch

= Installation =

In due course installation will be automated. For now:

* Download and uncompress the code on to your web server. Since there are no public-facing parts of the code, it is not necessary to have the library in the document root of a web site.
* Create a database in MySQL for sSearch to use (alternatively, use an existing database).
* In the _install_ directory, you will find a file called _install.sql_. You will need to run this SQL (e.g. through PHPMyAdmin) to create the necessary tables in your database.
* Create a file in the sSearch directory called config.local.php
* In this new file, copy and paste the following:

{{{
// Connection details
$config[ 'database.user' ] = '';
$config[ 'database.password' ] = '';
$config[ 'database.name' ] = '';
}}}

...and enter the relevant details.

That's it! It should be ready to go.
